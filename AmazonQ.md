# StoryVerse Project Documentation

This document provides an overview of the StoryVerse project documentation created with Amazon Q assistance.

## Project Overview

StoryVerse is an interactive platform where parents and children can create personalized stories by combining characters, settings, and themes from popular universes like Dragon Ball, Ninja Turtles, Futurama, Toy Story, Lion King, and Monsters Inc. The application generates illustrated storybooks with text and optional audio narration, tailored to the child's preferences and age-appropriate moral lessons.

This project serves as a demonstration of AWS EKS AutoMode capabilities, showcasing how a complex microservices architecture with varying resource requirements can efficiently scale across availability zones.

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the infrastructure using the provided Terraform code
2. Apply the Kubernetes manifests to set up the EKS cluster with AutoMode
3. Configure monitoring dashboards for EKS AutoMode demonstration
4. Run performance tests to validate scaling scenarios
5. Create demo stories to showcase the platform capabilities

## Using This Documentation

This documentation serves as a blueprint for implementing the StoryVerse application. Each component document includes:

- Feature descriptions
