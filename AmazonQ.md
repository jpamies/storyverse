# StoryVerse Project Documentation

This document provides an overview of the StoryVerse project documentation created with Amazon Q assistance.

## Project Overview

StoryVerse is an interactive platform where parents and children can create personalized stories by combining characters, settings, and themes from popular universes like Dragon Ball, Ninja Turtles, Futurama, Toy Story, Lion King, and Monsters Inc. The application generates illustrated storybooks with text and optional audio narration, tailored to the child's preferences and age-appropriate moral lessons.

This project serves as a demonstration of AWS EKS AutoMode capabilities, showcasing how a complex microservices architecture with varying resource requirements can efficiently scale across availability zones.

## Documentation Structure

### Main Documentation
- [README.md](README.md) - Project overview and main documentation

### Architecture Documentation
- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) - High-level system architecture
- [EKS AutoMode Scenarios](docs/architecture/eks-automode-scenarios.md) - Specific scenarios demonstrating EKS AutoMode capabilities

### Component Documentation
- [Frontend Layer](docs/components/frontend-layer.md) - User interface components
- [API Gateway Layer](docs/components/api-gateway-layer.md) - Request routing and authentication
- [Core Story Generation Layer](docs/components/core-story-generation-layer.md) - Story elements and structure

- [Analytics and Recommendation Layer](docs/components/analytics-recommendation-layer.md) - Usage tracking and personalization

## Implementation Status

All services have been successfully implemented and are ready for deployment. The implementation includes:

1. **Frontend Layer**: Complete UI components for story creation, character selection, preview, and parent dashboard
2. **API Gateway Layer**: Fully functional API gateway with authentication and rate limiting
3. **Core Story Generation Layer**: All services implemented with proper data models and APIs
4. **Content Generation Layer**: Text, image, and audio generation services with GPU/CPU optimizations
5. **Storage and Delivery Layer**: Distributed database and content delivery services
6. **Analytics and Recommendation Layer**: Usage tracking and personalized recommendation services

## Next Steps

1. Deploy the infrastructure using the provided Terraform code
2. Apply the Kubernetes manifests to set up the EKS cluster with AutoMode
3. Configure monitoring dashboards for EKS AutoMode demonstration
4. Run performance tests to validate scaling scenarios
5. Create demo stories to showcase the platform capabilities

## Using This Documentation

This documentation serves as a blueprint for implementing the StoryVerse application. Each component document includes:

- Feature descriptions
