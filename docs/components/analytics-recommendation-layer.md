## Workflow

### Analytics Flow
1. User interactions generate events (page views, clicks, story creations)
2. Events are streamed to the Usage Analytics Service
3. Real-time metrics are updated for dashboards
4. Batch processing aggregates data for reports
5. Insights are used to improve the platform

### Recommendation Flow
1. User begins story creation process
2. Recommendation Engine analyzes user history and preferences
3. Personalized suggestions are provided at each step
4. User selections are recorded to improve future recommendations
5. Completed story data feeds back into the recommendation model

### Feedback Flow
1. User provides rating and optional comments after story creation
2. Feedback Processing Service analyzes the feedback
3. Sentiment analysis extracts key themes and issues
4. Aggregated feedback informs content improvements
5. Critical issues trigger alerts for immediate attention

## Scaling Scenarios

### Daily Analytics Processing
Every night, the Usage Analytics Service processes the day's data to generate reports. EKS AutoMode scales this service during these batch processing windows and scales down during low-activity periods.

### Recommendation Model Training
Periodically, the Recommendation Engine retrains its models with new data. This CPU-intensive process requires temporary scaling, which AutoMode handles efficiently.

### Viral Content Feedback
When a particular story combination goes viral, the Feedback Processing Service experiences a surge in submissions. AutoMode scales this service to handle the increased load.

## Monitoring Metrics

| Service | Key Metrics |
|---------|-------------|
| Usage Analytics | Event ingestion rate, processing latency, storage utilization |
| Recommendation Engine | Recommendation requests, inference latency, model accuracy |
| Feedback Processing | Feedback submission rate, sentiment analysis accuracy, processing time |

## Cross-AZ Considerations

### Data Consistency
- Analytics data is eventually consistent across regions
- Recommendation models are synchronized periodically
- Feedback data is replicated for disaster recovery

### Processing Distribution
- Analytics processing is distributed across AZs
- Recommendation serving is available in all AZs
- Feedback processing is load-balanced across available resources

## Future Enhancements

- Implement A/B testing framework for feature optimization
- Add predictive analytics for user retention
- Develop advanced personalization based on reading patterns
- Create parent-specific recommendations based on educational goals
- Implement real-time anomaly detection for content quality issues
- Develop cross-family recommendations for social story sharing
