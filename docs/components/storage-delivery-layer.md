# Storage and Delivery Layer

## Overview

The Storage and Delivery Layer is responsible for persisting generated story content and efficiently delivering it to users. This layer ensures that stories are durably stored, quickly accessible, and optimally delivered across various devices and network conditions.

## Components

### Story Database

Stores completed and in-progress stories with metadata and relationships.

#### Features
- Story metadata storage
- Version history tracking
- User ownership and sharing permissions
- Story categorization and tagging
- Search indexing support
- Analytics data collection

#### Technologies
- Amazon DynamoDB or MongoDB
- Global tables for multi-region support
- Secondary indexes for efficient queries
- Time-to-live for temporary drafts

#### Scaling Considerations
- Read-heavy workload
- Cross-AZ replication
- Eventual consistency model
- On-demand capacity mode

#### EKS AutoMode Configuration
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1

## Scaling Scenarios

### Story Sharing Events
When users share stories on social media, the Content Delivery Service experiences increased load. EKS AutoMode scales this service based on bandwidth utilization and request rate.

### Media-Heavy Stories
Stories with many illustrations or audio narration require more storage and delivery resources. The Media Asset Service scales based on storage operations and bandwidth usage.

### Backup and Archive Operations
Periodic backup and archiving operations create batch workloads on the Story Database. AutoMode handles these planned capacity increases efficiently.

## Monitoring Metrics

| Service | Key Metrics |
|---------|-------------|
| Story Database | Read/write operations, storage utilization, query latency |
| Media Asset | Storage operations, bandwidth usage, asset processing time |
| Content Delivery | Delivery latency, cache hit ratio, bandwidth usage |

## Cross-AZ Considerations

### Data Replication
- Story metadata is replicated across AZs using DynamoDB global tables
- Media assets are replicated across regions using S3 cross-region replication
- Caches are synchronized using distributed cache invalidation

### Disaster Recovery
- Point-in-time recovery for database tables
- Multi-region backups for media assets
- Regular disaster recovery testing

### Performance Optimization
- Read replicas in each AZ for low-latency access
- Regional edge caches for frequently accessed content
- Content routing based on user location

## Future Enhancements

- Implement progressive web app capabilities for improved offline experience
- Add WebAssembly-based rendering for interactive story elements
- Integrate with voice assistants for hands-free story playback
- Implement AR features for enhanced story visualization
- Add collaborative story creation features for multiple users
