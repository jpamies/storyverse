# StoryVerse Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

StoryVerse uses a microservices architecture deployed on Amazon EKS with AutoMode enabled. This document provides a high-level overview of the system components and their interactions.

## Service Layers

The StoryVerse application is organized into several logical layers:

### 1. Frontend Layer
User-facing components that provide the interface for story creation and management.

### 2. API Gateway Layer
Services that handle routing, authentication, and rate limiting.

### 3. Core Story Generation Layer
Services responsible for managing story elements and generating plot structures.

### 4. Content Generation Layer
Services that produce the actual story content (text, images, audio).

### 5. Storage and Delivery Layer
Components that store and deliver the generated content to users.

### 6. Analytics and Recommendation Layer
Services that track usage patterns and provide recommendations.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns

### Security
- Authentication and authorization
- Content moderation
- Data encryption

### Scalability
- EKS AutoMode configuration
- Resource allocation strategies
- Scaling policies

### Reliability
- Cross-AZ data replication
- Fault tolerance mechanisms
- Backup and recovery procedures

### Monitoring
- Metrics collection
- Alerting
- Logging

## Data Flow

1. User selects story parameters in the frontend
2. API Gateway routes the request to appropriate services
3. Core Story Generation services create the story structure
4. Content Generation services produce text, images, and audio
5. Storage services persist the content
6. Content Delivery services return the completed story to the user

## EKS AutoMode Configuration

The application leverages EKS AutoMode to efficiently scale resources based on demand:

- GPU-intensive services (Image Generation) scale based on queue depth
- CPU-intensive services (Text Generation, Audio Narration) scale based on CPU utilization
- Stateless services scale based on request rate
- Database services maintain minimum replicas across AZs

## Resource Requirements

| Service | CPU | Memory | GPU | Scaling Metric |
|---------|-----|--------|-----|---------------|
| Frontend | Low | Low | None | Request rate |
| API Gateway | Medium | Medium | None | Request rate |
| Text Generation | High | High | None | CPU utilization |
| Image Generation | Medium | High | Required | Queue depth |
| Audio Narration | High | Medium | None | CPU utilization |
| Databases | Medium | High | None | Connection count |

## Deployment Strategy

The application is deployed using a combination of:

- Terraform for infrastructure provisioning
- Helm charts for Kubernetes resources
- CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with additional content sources
- Enhanced personalization capabilities
- Mobile application support
- Offline mode for previously generated stories
